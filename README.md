Hi there! üçπ

Ever found yourself thinking, "Maybe that last drink was a bit too much?" Well, ~~shit~~ **sip** happens.

That's why I made this Android widget: to help you avoid repeating those "oops" moments.

## Features

- **Set your max**: Decide how much is just enough (before it‚Äôs too much).
- **Pick your style**: Choose a look for your widget that matches your vibe.
- **Tap to sip**: Click the widget every time you take a drink ‚Äî no judgment here.
- **Watch your glass fill up**: Visual feedback so you know when to slow down.
- **Get notified**: If you lose track, the app will let you know (with sounds you can‚Äôt ignore ‚Äî but you can disable them, of course).
- **Reset the counter**: Ready for the next party? Just reset and start fresh!
- **Dark theme support**: Prefer things a little moodier? The settings screen will follow your device‚Äôs theme ‚Äî if your phone is in dark mode, so is your settings.

## Why?

Sometimes, a little help goes a long way in keeping your glass half full (and not overflowing).
